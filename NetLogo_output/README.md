# NetLogo outputs

This is where the files produced after running the simulations (using `R/generate_simulations.Rmd`) are saved. They are not included in the repo because they are too large.

A copy of the main `.csv` file to be saved here can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5830996, if you don't want/don't have time to run the entire code from scratch, and just want to check how the simulations were analysed.
