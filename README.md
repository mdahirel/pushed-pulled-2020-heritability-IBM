repo DOI to add here after first release

This repository contains all data and code needed to re-do the analyses and figures in our manuscript

"Individual variation in dispersal, and its sources, shape the fate of pushed vs. pulled range expansions" (by Maxime Dahirel, Chlo√© Guicharnaud and Elodie Vercken)

This folder is a RStudio project folder, and the script uses the `here` package (see also [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)) to ensure all files paths are relative. If you run the scripts for the first time, various time-consuming outputs will be saved in the `R_output` and `NetLogo_output` folders so you don't have to re-run them everytime.
