# R scripts

Here are the R scripts used to generate simulation runs (`generate_simulations.Rmd`) and then analyse them once they're done (`analyse_simulations.Rmd`). 

This folder also contains the code to generate the supplementary material PDF (`supplementary.Rmd`). 
Important: if one wants to re-knit the supplementary material file, please note that that file calls for some outputs saved while running the previous scripts (`generate_simulations` and `analyse_simulations`). 
So one will need to re-run at least `analyse_simulations` if these outputs do not exist (for instance if you just downloaded this from the GitHub/Zenodo archive)
